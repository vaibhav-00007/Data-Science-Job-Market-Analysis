# Overview
Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles in India. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market and apply Python skills more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from Luke Barousse's Python Course provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions
Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1) What skills are most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2) How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3) How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4) What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying)

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

**Python**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights. I also used the following Python libraries:
**Pandas Library**: This was used to analyze the data.
**Matplotlib Library**: I visualized the data.
**Seaborn Library**: Helped me create more advanced visuals.
**Jupyter Notebooks**: The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
**Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.
